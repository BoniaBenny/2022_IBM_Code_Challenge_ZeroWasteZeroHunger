Many needful people in a locality , often is deprived of atleast one time food. 
And what is better than homely food.

But unfortunately,  lot of food is wasted on a daily basis . 

Solution:
Connecting homes in  locality , and creating a database ,  to monitor  if any good amount of  fresh food is left , on a daily basis , which can be provided to the needy . 
Wastage of food can be minimized in larger quantities.
